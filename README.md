libamiibo
========
amiiboâ„¢ parsing library, now with AmiiboApi Support and in .NET 6

Usage
=====
**libamiibo expects a binary dump. It will not work with XMLs or hexadecimal text files**.  See the unix program `xxd` to convert from hexadecimal to binary.

It offers support for encryption/decryption, figurine data, amiibo settings and AppData.

To parse a tag directly from a binary (encrypted) dump, use ```new LibAmiibo().ReadEncryptedTag(..)```.

When using an encrypted binary, the Settings and AppData information will not contain any valid information.

Examples
--------
!! You will need the AmiiboApi database, check notice !!

- Decrypting a NTAG215 dump "mario.bin" with the "retail.bin" keys:
When instantiating `LibAmiibo`, enter the path to the retail.bin.
To set the CDNKeys, call static `CDNUtils.LoadCDNKey(..)` with the keys path.
```
byte[] encryptedNtagData = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes("mario.bin");
var lib = new LibAmiibo("retail.bin");
var amiiboTag = lib.DecryptTag(encryptedNtagData);
```

- Parsing a NTAG215 dump "mario.bin" only for the non-encrypted information:
```
byte[] encryptedNtagData = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes("mario.bin");
var amiiboTag = new LibAmiibo().ReadEncryptedTag(encryptedNtagData);
```

Notice
------
This LibAmiibo Modification doesn includes images or Amiibo information data anymore.
To be more update friendly, it now includes a simple implementation to make use of N3evin/AmiiboAPI.
For functionality it is required to download "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N3evin/AmiiboAPI/master/database/amiibo.json"
and put besides the libammibo.dll into `./AmiiboApi/amiibo.json` or you can call `UpdateLocalAmiiboData()` from LibAmiibo.

To download images, either download them manually from "https://github.com/N3evin/AmiiboAPI/tree/master/images"
and put besides the libammibo.dll into `./AmiiboApi/images/` with the same naming as from the git or you can call `UpdateMissingLocalAmiiboImages()` from LibAmiibo to get all images.

To get single images, call `GetLocalAmiiboImage` from LibAmiibo with the Amiibo Hex Id and if it should be downloaded if its missings.
